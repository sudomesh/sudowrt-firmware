The sudo mesh firmware builder.

NOTICE: This is still a work in progress. Don't expect it to work.

Only contains patches and build scripts. 

What the prepare script does:

1. Downloads OpenWRT

2. Patches OpenWRT with sudo mesh patches (actually we don't yet have any patches).

3. Adds a feed to get OpenWRT to pull in the sudomesh/openwrt-packages feed from github. 
The openwrt-packages contains references to the code for the actual sudo mesh openwrt-packages 
(that each have their own github repositories).

What the build_package script does:

Builds a single package for the specified platform, e.g.:

  build_package -a atheros internetisdownredirect 

The built packages will end up in the built_packages/ directory

What the build script does:

Nothing right now, but in the future it will build OpenWRT firmwares for the target platforms 
as specified in the openwrt/architectures file.
